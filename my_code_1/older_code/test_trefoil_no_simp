'''
This is me trying to see how to create a knot 
using Gauss Code and without simplifying the knot.
'''



import pyknotid.representations as rep_
import numpy as np
import sys
import pyknotid.make as mk

gc = rep_.GaussCode('1+a,2-a,3+a,1-a,2+a,3-a')


rep = rep_.Representation(gc)

k = rep.space_curve(bool=False)

k.plot()

'''
We have changed space_curve() to take an 
extra argument to make it not simplify.

We also know now that plot does no simplifications.

Also, identify() performs simplify, since it is trying
to know what knot is passsed.

#print(k.identify())
